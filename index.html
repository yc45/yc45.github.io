            <p>Hi tt,</p>
            <p>Your first? virtual card haha.</p>
            <p>It wasn't the best start to the year because of the virus but there has been many big moments. You graduating,
                starting your new job soon, and us finishing our first book. I'm so proud of all your accomplishments and
                am glad to see you enjoying the new city.</p>
            <p>I wish I could be there to celebrate your special day. I love spending every moment with you and
                can't wait to see you again.</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday!</p>
